## Getting Started

This section will guide you on **how to run the project on your local machine**.

### Prerequisites

List all the software you need to have installed before you can run the project.

*   **Node.js** (v16 or higher is recommended)
    ```sh
    # You can check your version with:
    node -v
    ```
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager)
    ```sh
    # You can check your version with:
    npm -v
    ```
*   **PostgreSQL** or another database if you are using one.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-platform.git
    cd ecommerce-platform
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies**
    If you have a `backend` folder, navigate into it and install the packages.
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**
    If you have a `frontend` folder, do the same.
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    Many projects require a `.env` file for secret keys and configuration. Create a `.env` file in your `backend` directory and add the necessary variables.
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@localhost:5432/your_db_name"
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
    STRIPE_API_KEY="sk_test_..."
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    In the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    npm run start:dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server**
    In a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

After these steps, your application should be running locally. You can typically view it by opening your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
